## Project Overview

Our goal with the NFT Collection Manager is to create a publishing platform that leverages EOS’s robustness and attracts gaming studios to a more simplistic and user friendly launchpad. We believe the integration of the Collection Manager with additional features down the road will be a very compelling choice, supporting EOS in its endeavor to become a premier gaming blockchain, while maintaining excitement for other trends and collections.

### Overview

- **Name:** NFT Collection Manager
- **Brief Description:** An interface to the AtomicAssets standard which makes it easy to manage your own Atomic NFT Collections, and plugins to ensure high quality releases and gamification integration.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** FACINGS has been launching AtomicAssets NFTs  since its inception in early 2021. Its parent company and initial investor, Detroit Ledger Technologies (formerly EOS DETROIT), has been in the Antelope/EOSIO ecosystem since its inception as a pioneer block producer on EOS and other Antelope blockchains.
- **Reason for Interest:** Our team and experience combined with the need for an open-source creator that is friendlier to use makes for a perfect fit. The lack of development on EOS for NFTs and gamification resources makes it a necessity going forward.


### Project Details

**Mock-ups/designs of any UI components**

These designs are from past prototypes, to give an example, but does not represent the final product: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iN2bQJhB_w_A_fKXC8-iYr3Re2-rbqSt

**Data models of the core functionality**

The data model will be largely based on the AtomicAssets [schema](https://github.com/pinknetworkx/atomicassets-contract/wiki/Tables).

**API specifications of the core functionality**

We seek to implement the entirety of the [AtomicAssets](https://github.com/pinknetworkx/atomicassets-contract/wiki/Actions) allowed actions in the NFT Collection Manager, bringing together the power of existing actions into the EOS framework for implementation with complex collections and gamification.


**An overview of the technology stack to be used**

The NFT Collection Manager is a client-side app built in NextJS and talks directly with public blockchain API nodes. Our goal is to minimize dependencies. Therefore we intend for all of the data to be stored on-chain, with IPFS being used to store all NFT images.


**Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed**

- Jungle4 EOS testnet support
- Data handling/validation
- TypeScript implementation
- Plugin Architecture
  - Data standard & import functionality
  - Smart Airdrops


**PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic**

We have an internal proof of concept that was shared in our previous grant application. The creator is currently hosted at https://creator.facings.io. You can see the details of our previous grant here: https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/blob/main/applications/facings-nft-collection-manager.md


**What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement**

Stage 1 was designed to generate a proof of concept working feature set on which we are immediately following up with a Stage 2 grant proposal to maximize the use and effectiveness of the Collection Manager and add feature sets toward our goals of easy collection management and gamification. Our project will not include or promote NFT sales, token creation, token backing, or the staking of NFTs. No drops will be possible with Stage 2 of the project, aside from airdrops and basic transfers.


### Ecosystem Fit

**Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?**

The only NFT creator on EOS is AtomicHub, which is closed source and allows collection owners to publish NFTs. Our project will provide an open source solution for EOS that is easy to use. Another relevant project is NeftyBlocks; they have many advanced features but their UI is also closed-source and only available on WAX. Advancing NFTs, play & earn, and GameFi on EOS with an easy to use, functional collection manager fills a void in the EOS NFT ecosystem.


**Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?**

Our target audience consists of game developers, creators, and members of the EOS community and other Antelope chains. We aim to encourage members of other chains to create on EOS in the future. By leveling the playing field on EOS with improved tooling, there is a compelling argument for game producers and collection enthusiasts to develop and launch on EOS.


**What need(s) does your project meet?**

The AtomicHub creator is a barebones UI integrating directly to a blockchain node, as well as their own internal IPFS node for file storage. It is available to everyone and anyone may publish without limits using their own resources. Nefty’s creator is much more complex with features like Pack Generation and Blending. However, neither of these platforms are open source.

We have created an open-source NFT collection manager which is both fully functional on its own, and represents a reference implementation of the AtomicAssets standard across the Antelope ecosystem as an open-source alternative to the other two choices. On top of the core functionality, we are excited to enable advanced workflows and gamification with a plugin system. By leveraging the existing Atomic standard, anyone is able to produce feature rich NFTs and manage them seamlessly, creating a launchpad for gamification that can be a boon to the EOS network. EOS has the opportunity to be a big player in the gaming market which is struggling to find operating chains that fulfill all of the utility of blockchain with decentralized NFT ownership. The market is ripe to take the next step and EOS is poised to be the platform of choice.


**Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?**

There are no viable open source projects meeting this need.

## Future Plans

As indicated in the Development Status section, FACINGS set out to build a fully custodial NFT launchpad which serves as a bridge into web3 for brands, creators, and games looking to integrate NFTs into their product offerings. Our vision is to streamline access to tools for managing composable NFT use cases, and abstract away the complexity of tapping into them for entities that do not have a pre-existing knowledge of web3, or may not be technical in nature. In some cases with big firms, they may not have a policy for accounting for crypto even, making participation that requires holding and securing tokens difficult.

The NFT Collection Manager is a stepping stone towards realizing that vision, setting the foundational elements of our content management experience for publishers, and making them available for all to use and build upon.

Our goal is to create a platform that leverages EOS’s robustness and attracts gaming studios to a more simplistic and user friendly launch. We believe the integration of the creator UI with additional features down the road will be a very compelling choice, turning EOS into the premier gamification center, while maintaining excitement for other trends and collections. 

FACINGS envisions sustaining our business with a premium tier of features built on top of the open source core, with a usage-based business model (pay-as-you-publish). Premium features incorporated as plugins could include facilitation of sales, redeemable NFTs, composable crafting, and support for mint on demand and preminted packs.

The integration of the plugin system further opens up this project to growth and contributions which can be leveraged by any fork or maintainer. By allowing new functionality to be added as encapsulated plugins, it becomes safer and simpler to create and share new features without requiring modifications to the core, nor new forks or diverging codebases.

Future features that could also be valuable to prioritize work on includes integrating best-of-breed onboarding experiences, automatic collection microsite generation (configurable sales sites), enabling purchasers to pay for their own on-chain account with a credit card in the purchasing flow, and richer functionality to support the needs of NFT-integrated games including event triggers for mutable data.
